# ksp-mockup
Ksp mockup is simple ksp (Kotlin Symbol Processing) library for generating fake mockup data. These are
handy  and convenient to be used in @Preview functions  in Jetpack Compose applications. Instead of 
creating @PreviewParameterProvider just get mockup data with Mockup object.

## Add Library
Add maven repository and library dependency to your app's gradle files. Make sure to add ksp plugin too.

**Project's build.gradle.ksp**
```kotlin
// Project's build.gradle.kts make sure to keep compatible ksp version with your kotlin version 
plugins {
    id("org.jetbrains.kotlin.android") version "1.9.10" apply false
    id("com.google.devtools.ksp") version "1.9.10-1.0.13" apply false
}
```

**Project's settings.gradle.ksp**
```kotlin
// Adds maven 
dependencyResolutionManagement {
    repositories {
        maven(url = "https://maven.pkg.github.com/miroslavhybler/Maven")
    }
}
```

**Application's module build.gradle.kts**
```kotlin
// Apply ksp plugin
plugins {
    id("com.google.devtools.ksp")
}


dependencies {
    val mockupVersion= "1.0.0"
    implementation("mir.oslav.mockup:annotations:$mockupVersion")
    ksp("mir.oslav.mockup:annotations:$mockupVersion")
    ksp("mir.oslav.mockup:processor:$mockupVersion")
}
```

### Usage
Annotate desired classes with @Mockup and that's it

```kotlin
@Mockup
data class User constructor(
    val id: Int,
    val firstName: String,
    val lastName: String,
)
```

Build your project and access generated data through generated Mockup object.

```kotlin
val user = Mockup.user.single
val usersLis = Mockup.user.list
```

### Supported types
- Simple kotlin types like Int, Long, ...
- String which will contain "Lorem ipsum..." text
- List (kotlin.List), but only when list contains simple type or @Mockup annotated classes, other types won't work
- Arrays with known type (like IntArray, FloatArray, ...) are generated empty
- Classes annotated with @Mockup annotation

### Limitations 
- Not applicable to to java classes and java types
- Any other types that are not specified in [Supported types](#Supported-types) are **not** supported and code generation will fail.
- Generated data are **not** aggregated between each other! Don't try to access data based on id's or something.
